            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify;">
                I am an undergraduate student pursuing Computer Engineering at the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University, Nepal. My primary areas of interest include Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Mathematics, and Computational Problem Solving. Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and staying active by watching and playing sports.
<br>
Currently, I am working on a Computer Vision Project focused on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for Devanagari (Nepali) Handwritten Characters. This involves building a dataset and developing a model tailored to this low-resource language. Through this project, I aim to address key challenges in the field of AI for underserved languages.
<br>
I aspire to become a researcher in the AI/ML field, with a particular focus on Computer Vision and Robotics. My technical expertise includes a strong foundation in Python and C++, along with hands-on experience using advanced AI libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.
<br>
My life motto is, "The only competition I have is Yesterday's Me," which reflects my commitment to continuous self-improvement and personal growth in both my academic and professional pursuits.
